## üìú Core Scripts and Usage

### 1. `deploy_dao.js`
Deploys core contracts (Governance, Vault, DAO)
```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy/deploy_dao.js --network yourNetwork
```

### 2. `verify_s47_proof.js`
Verifies DAO membership by submitting a BTC-style signature
- Requires `S47_SIGNATURE` and `VERIFIER_CONTRACT` in `.env`

### 3. `submit_proposal.js`
Submits a proposal to the DAO with a title and IPFS hash

### 4. `track_proposal_results.js`
Tracks proposal status and vote count (YES/NO)

### 5. `create_snapshot.js`
Triggers a token holder snapshot used for voting eligibility

## ‚öôÔ∏è Environment Variables (`.env`)
Most scripts rely on the following environment variables:

```env
DAO_CONTRACT=0xDAOContractAddressHere
VERIFIER_CONTRACT=0xVerifierContractAddressHere
S47_SIGNATURE=0xBitcoinFormattedSignature
PROPOSAL_ID=1
```

---

## üìå Notes
- All scripts use `ethers.js` and `hardhat`
- You can automate with `npm run` commands by defining them in `package.json`
- These scripts are fundamental for DAO infrastructure auditing, testing, and archival integrity

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Recommendations
- Do not store private keys or mnemonics directly in `.env`
- Update contract addresses in `.env` when redeploying
- Always test thoroughly on testnet before executing on mainnet
