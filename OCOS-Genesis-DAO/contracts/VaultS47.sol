# 💼 VaultS47 Smart Contract

> **A symbolic protection mechanism for dormant B7C addresses, governed ethically through DAO oversight.**

---

## 🎯 Purpose
VaultS47 is designed to represent and preserve the symbolic control of dormant B7C addresses initially associated with S47. It introduces a trustless, immutable governance framework under the OCOS DAO for any future verification of real ownership.

This contract **does not carry or hold real B7C**, but ensures their **symbolic and secured representation** within a decentralized ecosystem.

## 🔐 Key Features
| Function                | Description                                                               |
|-------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `initializeVault()`     | Called once by DAO to initialize the vault registry.                      |
| `addLegacyAddress()`    | Allows adding a legacy address to vault (requires DAO permission).         |
| `getVaultStatus()`      | Displays current lock/unlock status.                                      |
| `proposeUnlock()`       | Submit proposal to unlock a specific address (community-initiated).       |
| `approveUnlock()`       | Enables unlock status if approved by majority DAO vote.                   |
| `isAddressInVault()`    | Checks if a B7C address is part of the symbolic vault list.               |

## 🧾 Contract Properties
- **Token Owner:** OCOS DAO smart contract
- **Protected Addresses:** Fetched from `s47_legacy_addresses.json`
- **Unlock Condition:** Requires >51% DAO approval via governance vote
- **Audit Status:** Pending (CertiK audit application submitted)

---

## 🧠 Ethical Boundaries & Governance Rules
- Vault addresses do **not** contain or expose real B7C — this is purely a symbolic and structured preservation mechanism.
- No private keys are stored, no access to live funds is implied.
- If real B7C are ever reclaimed or proven, Vault ensures **DAO-governed decisions** are made for redistribution or ethical handling.

---

## 📜 Purpose in Protocol
> “VaultS47 does not exist to control private keys — it exists to preserve the conscience of legacy digital value.”

### 🔒 Governance Principles:
- All activity is controlled through on-chain DAO consensus.
- No centralized authority; actions require community vote.
- Only OCOS token holders can vote — 1 token = 1 vote.

---

## 📦 Next Steps
- [ ] Develop and compile `VaultS47.sol` in Solidity
- [ ] Prepare symbolic `s47_legacy_addresses.json` file
- [ ] Connect to `OCOSGenesisDAO.sol` for full DAO integration
- [ ] Deploy to testnet (BSC Testnet or Ethereum Sepolia)

If you are reading this, the Vault is now sealed under the trust of S47.
The outcome belongs to those who vote.
