## OCOS DAO – Security Policy

Welcome to the OCOS DAO Security Policy.  
Our organization is committed to maintaining the highest standards of security and transparency for all smart contracts, applications, and community assets.  
We actively encourage responsible disclosure of vulnerabilities and operate under a “security-first, transparency-by-default” philosophy.

---

## 1. Responsible Vulnerability Disclosure

If you discover a security vulnerability within any part of the OCOS DAO ecosystem (smart contracts, frontend, backend, treasury scripts, or documentation), **please report it responsibly** as outlined below.

**Contact Channels:**
- Email: security@ocos.io
- GitHub Security Advisories: [Create a private report](https://github.com/OCOSToken/OCOS-DAO/security/advisories/new)
- Optionally, contact a core team member via Discord (security ticket).

**Responsible Disclosure Principles:**
- Do **not** publicly disclose the vulnerability before the DAO team has had a reasonable opportunity to address it.
- Provide a clear, detailed description including affected components, possible exploits, and proof-of-concept where applicable.
- The OCOS DAO team will confirm receipt within 48 hours and coordinate remediation with you.

---

## 2. Scope

This policy applies to **all OCOS DAO public repositories, smart contracts deployed on mainnet/testnet, DAO treasury addresses, APIs, web interfaces, and official documentation.**

**Out of Scope Examples:**
- Issues on third-party dependencies unless they directly impact OCOS DAO security.
- Social engineering or phishing attacks against community members.
- Denial of service (DoS) against public APIs.

---

## 3. Bug Bounty and Rewards

The OCOS DAO actively supports a community-driven bug bounty program.  
**Critical vulnerabilities affecting funds, DAO governance, or user security may be rewarded with bounties in OCOS tokens, BTC, or stablecoins.**

- Bounty levels are determined by risk, impact, and exploitability.
- To qualify, always use the responsible disclosure process.
- The DAO may publicly acknowledge your contribution if you wish.

---

## 4. Security Best Practices & Continuous Audit

- All smart contracts are subject to rigorous peer review and at least two independent security audits before mainnet deployment.
- Code changes require mandatory code review, automated linting, and continuous integration (CI) checks.
- All private keys, multisig wallets, and admin credentials are stored in secure, access-controlled vaults.  
- The DAO treasury operates exclusively with multi-signature (multisig) wallets.  
- All contracts and treasury movements are monitored on-chain via open-source scripts and dashboards.
- Automated monitoring alerts are in place for abnormal DAO or contract activity.

---

## 5. Smart Contract Risk Management

- Immutable contracts are used for critical treasury or governance logic.
- Upgradeable contracts follow OpenZeppelin standards, with full transparency and audit trails for all upgrades.
- Timelock mechanisms are implemented for protocol upgrades, allowing community review before activation.
- Emergency “pause” functions exist for critical protocol components, but require multisig or DAO-wide approval.
- DAO treasury addresses and Genesis Bitcoin addresses are published and verifiable.

---

## 6. Incident Response

- Security incidents are prioritized and responded to within 24–72 hours, depending on severity.
- Critical incidents (funds at risk, governance exploit) trigger DAO emergency protocols, including possible smart contract pause and public incident disclosure.
- All post-mortem reports will be made public after issue remediation.

---

## 7. Reporting Timeline

1. **Report Submission:** Vulnerability or bug is reported through the designated channels.
2. **Acknowledgement:** DAO security team confirms receipt within 48 hours.
3. **Assessment:** Issue is analyzed and risk-assessed within 7 days.
4. **Remediation:** Patch or fix is implemented as soon as possible. Severe issues prioritized.
5. **Public Disclosure:** After mitigation, a public disclosure and post-mortem will be published, crediting the reporter unless anonymity is requested.
