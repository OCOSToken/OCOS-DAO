## 2. Remediation Process üîß

1. **Issue Triage:**  
   Each finding was reviewed and prioritized by the development and audit teams based on its potential impact.

2. **Remediation Actions:**  
   The relevant fixes were implemented according to industry best practices (e.g., using OpenZeppelin libraries, following CertiK/SlowMist recommendations).

3. **Peer Review & Testing:**  
   All code changes underwent peer review and comprehensive testing, including unit, integration, and simulation tests.

4. **Verification by Auditors:**  
   The original auditors reviewed the applied fixes and signed off on each resolution. Where applicable, blockchain transaction hashes or audit firm approval letters are included as proof.

## 3. Evidence of Remediation üîó

- **Commit Hashes:**  
  All code fixes are referenced by their unique commit hash on GitHub.  
  Example:  
  `Reentrancy fix:` [commit a8b9...](https://github.com/OCOSToken/OCOS-DAO/commit/a8b9...)

- **Pull Requests:**  
  Major remediations were merged via transparent pull requests, each linked to the original finding.  
  Example:  
  `Access Control improvement:` [PR #24](https://github.com/OCOSToken/OCOS-DAO/pull/24)

- **Test Reports:**  
  Automated test coverage and simulation reports are available in [tools/coverage.md](../tools/coverage.md) üòä

- **External Audit Verification:**  
  Auditor confirmation and follow-up letters are available in [audit-log/2025-01-final.md](../audit-log/2025-01-final.md)

## 4. Outstanding & Ongoing Issues üïì

As of this report, **all critical and high-risk issues have been remediated**. Any remaining low-priority findings, suggestions, or community feedback are being tracked [here](../outstanding.md) and will be addressed in upcoming releases.

---

## 5. Commitment to Transparency & Security üåç

The OCOS DAO team remains fully committed to transparency, continuous improvement, and open-source security best practices.
