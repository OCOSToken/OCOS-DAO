# OCOS DAO Tokenomics

## 1. Introduction

This document details the tokenomics of the OCOS DAO ecosystem, providing a transparent overview of supply structure, utility, distribution, economic incentives, deflationary mechanics, and governance integration. All models are designed to ensure long-term sustainability, maximum transparency, and fair value creation for every DAO member.

## 4. Utility & Use Cases

OCOS is designed as the **core governance and utility token** of the DAO, with direct use cases such as:

- **Governance:**  
  Submit, discuss, and vote on DAO proposals; every OCOS represents 1 voting right.
- **Staking & Rewards:**  
  Stake OCOS to earn protocol rewards, yield farming, and unlock advanced platform features.
- **DAO Treasury Access:**  
  Only token holders can propose and approve treasury expenditures.
- **Airdrop Eligibility:**  
  Holders are prioritized for all future ecosystem airdrops and exclusive NFT distributions.
- **Ecosystem Participation:**  
  Access to exclusive DeFi products, launchpads, events, and platform privileges.
- **Fee Discounts:**  
  Reduced fees for using OCOS-powered products or exchanging on partnered platforms.

---

## 5. Deflationary & Incentive Mechanisms

To ensure healthy value appreciation and mitigate inflation, the following mechanisms are implemented:

- **Buyback & Burn:**  
  A fixed % of all protocol fees and DEX trading revenue is used to buy back OCOS from the market and permanently burn them, reducing circulating supply.
- **Vesting and Cliff Periods:**  
  Team and advisor tokens are vested, aligning incentives for long-term development.
- **Slashing (Penalty) Events:**  
  Malicious actors or proposal abusers can have tokens slashed based on DAO vote.
- **Dynamic Emission:**  
  All new incentives and token emissions require DAO approval and are transparently tracked.

---

## 6. Governance Integration

- **On-chain Voting:**  
  All major decisions, treasury movements, rule changes, and protocol upgrades are subject to community vote on-chain using OCOS tokens.
- **Multisig Wallets:**  
  Treasury is managed by a minimum 4/7 multisig – signers are elected by DAO.
- **Proposal Submission:**  
  Any OCOS holder can submit a governance proposal, subject to minimum quorum and proposal deposit.

---

## 7. Transparency & Audit

- **Live Dashboard:**  
  Real-time token distribution, liquidity, and treasury analytics on [dao.ocos.io](https://dao.ocos.io)
- **Independent Audits:**  
  Smart contracts and treasury flows are audited annually by independent third parties, with public reports in `/docs/audit-reports/`.
- **Open-Source Code:**  
  All contracts and DAO logic are published under open source, inviting external review.

## 8. Economic Model & Future Updates

OCOS DAO’s tokenomics are regularly reviewed by both the DAO and external experts. Adjustments (e.g., new emission schedules, changes to incentives, partnership allocations) are only possible through successful DAO proposals and community consensus.

---

## 9. FAQ

**Q: Can the total supply ever be increased?**  
A: No. The smart contract permanently caps the supply at 100,000,000 OCOS.

**Q: Who controls the treasury?**  
A: The DAO via multi-signature wallet, controlled only by elected DAO signers and never by any single individual or team.

**Q: Where can I verify token allocation and spending?**  
A: All allocations, wallet addresses, and spending are transparently published on-chain and on GitHub under `/treasury/`.
