# Audit Methodology

## Introduction

This document outlines the comprehensive methodology used in the security auditing of the OCOS DAO smart contracts and related infrastructure. Our approach is designed to ensure full transparency, maximum risk coverage, and compliance with global best practices in blockchain and decentralized finance (DeFi) security.

## 1. Audit Objectives

- **Identify Vulnerabilities:**  
  Detect critical, high, medium, and low-level security risks in smart contracts and the protocol ecosystem.
- **Verify Functionality:**  
  Ensure that all contract functions operate as intended, without logical or business process errors.
- **Assess Compliance:**  
  Evaluate compliance with industry standards (OpenZeppelin, CertiK, ISO/IEC 27001, etc.) and regulatory requirements.
- **Review Upgradeability:**  
  Analyze upgradability mechanisms, proxy patterns, and emergency recovery functions.
- **Evaluate Decentralization:**  
  Check that governance and admin privileges are consistent with DAO principles.

## 2. Scope Definition

- **Smart Contracts:**  
  All core and auxiliary contracts deployed on mainnet and testnet.
- **Integration Points:**  
  Oracle services, treasury management, multi-signature wallets, and third-party protocol interactions.
- **Frontend/Backend Security:**  
  Basic security review of user-facing interfaces (if included in audit scope).
- **Documentation:**  
  Review of technical documentation, deployment scripts, and configuration files for security consistency.

## 3. Audit Process

### 3.1. Information Gathering

- Collect full source code, architecture diagrams, and deployment histories.
- Obtain protocol specifications, documentation, and governance policies.

### 3.2. Automated Analysis

- Use industry-leading static analysis tools (e.g., Slither, MythX, Securify) to identify common vulnerabilities:
  - Reentrancy
  - Integer overflow/underflow
  - Front-running and MEV risks
  - Access control issues
  - Unchecked external calls

### 3.3. Manual Code Review

- Line-by-line, function-level analysis by experienced blockchain security experts.
- Focus on logic flaws, business rule violations, and economic attack vectors (flash loan, oracle manipulation).

### 3.4. Functional Testing

- Write and execute comprehensive test cases and unit tests (using Hardhat, Foundry, or Truffle).
- Simulate attack scenarios, edge cases, and user misbehavior.

### 3.5. Risk Classification

- Categorize findings as **Critical**, **High**, **Medium**, or **Low** based on potential impact and likelihood.
- Provide detailed technical explanations and risk assessments for each issue.

### 3.6. Remediation Support

- Collaborate with the development team to clarify issues and verify fixes.
- Re-audit resolved findings, provide proof of remediation (commit hashes, deployment verification).

### 3.7. Final Reporting

- Prepare a transparent, public-facing audit report, including:
  - Executive summary
  - Full vulnerability list with status (open/resolved)
  - Recommendations and risk mitigation strategies
  - Appendices for technical references

## 4. Standards and References

- **OWASP Smart Contract Security Guidelines**
- **Ethereum Smart Contract Best Practices (Consensys, OpenZeppelin)**
- **CertiK, SlowMist, Hacken Audit Procedures**
- **ISO/IEC 27001:2013 Information Security Management**
- **Relevant regulatory and compliance requirements (where applicable)**

---

## 5. Transparency and Continuous Improvement

- All audit results are published in full and are accessible to the OCOS DAO community.
- The audit process is subject to periodic review and enhancement to incorporate new security threats and emerging industry standards.
- Community and third-party feedback is actively encouraged to maintain the highest security posture.
