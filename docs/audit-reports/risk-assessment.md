# Risk Assessment – OCOS DAO

## Overview

This document provides a comprehensive **risk assessment** of the OCOS DAO smart contract ecosystem and operational infrastructure. The purpose is to transparently identify, categorize, and evaluate all potential security and operational risks, and to provide a basis for ongoing improvement, compliance, and community trust.

## Methodology

The risk assessment is conducted according to industry best practices, including but not limited to:
- OWASP Smart Contract Security Guidelines
- CERTIK and SlowMist methodologies
- ISO/IEC 27005:2018 (Information Security Risk Management)
- OpenZeppelin’s Audit Framework

All risks are identified through a combination of:
- Manual code review  
- Automated static and dynamic analysis tools (MythX, Slither, Securify, Oyente, etc.)
- Penetration testing and simulated attack scenarios
- Protocol logic, governance process, and treasury operations evaluation

## Risk Categories

Risks are grouped into four primary categories:

1. **Critical Risk** – Vulnerabilities that can lead to complete loss of funds, contract ownership, or protocol integrity.  
   _Immediate remediation required. May lead to system halt or catastrophic failure if exploited._

2. **High Risk** – Issues that could result in significant financial, operational, or governance impact, but do not threaten the entire protocol.  
   _Priority remediation strongly recommended._

3. **Medium Risk** – Weaknesses that may be exploited under certain conditions, potentially causing limited losses or system disruption.  
   _Remediation advised as part of ongoing development._

4. **Low/Informational Risk** – Minor issues or best practice deviations, unlikely to cause significant harm but may affect code quality, auditability, or user trust.  
   _Fixing recommended for improved robustness and compliance._

## Risk Assessment Matrix

| Category     | Impact                     | Likelihood    | Example                                 | Response             |
|--------------|----------------------------|---------------|-----------------------------------------|----------------------|
| Critical     | Total loss/compromise      | Unlikely-High | Private key leak, reentrancy attack     | Immediate fix, halt  |
| High         | Major disruption/loss      | Possible      | Governance manipulation, price oracle   | Fast patch, alert    |
| Medium       | Partial disruption         | Possible      | Gas inefficiency, rate limits, DoS      | Next dev cycle fix   |
| Low/Info     | Minimal impact             | Rare          | Typo, outdated dependency, UX warning   | Maintenance cycle    |

## Current Risk Summary

- **Critical:** _None outstanding at this time. All previously discovered critical issues have been remediated and verified._
- **High:** _One high risk finding (Governance delay exploit), currently in mitigation – see [findings/high.md](./findings/high.md)._
- **Medium:** _Several issues related to minor gas optimizations and access control granularity. Addressed in upcoming releases._
- **Low/Info:** _Minor best practice notes and documentation improvements. Tracked in [findings/low.md](./findings/low.md)._

## Recommendations

- **Continuous Monitoring:** All contracts are subject to ongoing automated and manual security monitoring.
- **Community Alerts:** Any newly discovered risk will be disclosed to the community within 24 hours and tracked publicly in this repository.
- **Multi-Sig Governance:** All treasury and upgrade operations are secured by multi-signature wallets to minimize single point-of-failure risk.
- **Periodic Audits:** Third-party security audits will be conducted before every major release or protocol upgrade.
- **Bug Bounty Program:** An ongoing bug bounty incentivizes the discovery and responsible disclosure of vulnerabilities.

## Conclusion

The OCOS DAO maintains a strong commitment to security, transparency, and continuous improvement. All risks, past and present, are documented here to uphold the highest standards of trust and compliance.
