# Audit Scope â€” OCOS DAO

## Overview

This document precisely defines the **scope of the security audit** performed on the OCOS DAO smart contracts and associated infrastructure. Clearly outlining the boundaries of the audit allows for transparent assessment, measurable responsibility, and clear expectations for both the community and third-party stakeholders.

---

## 1. Objectives of the Audit

- **Evaluate the security, correctness, and robustness** of the OCOS DAO smart contract ecosystem.
- Identify vulnerabilities, logic flaws, and potential attack vectors.
- Verify compliance with international security standards and best practices (e.g., OWASP, SWC Registry, ISO/IEC 27001).
- Assess upgradeability, governance mechanisms, and protocol integrity.

---

## 2. Audit Coverage

The scope of this audit includes:

### A. **Smart Contracts**

- **OCOS DAO Core Contract**  
  Governance, proposal management, voting, and execution modules.
- **Treasury Management Contracts**  
  Multi-signature wallet, fund allocation, withdrawal, and reserve logic.
- **Token Contracts**  
  OCOS Token (ERC-20/BEP-20), vesting, distribution, and reward contracts.
- **Staking and Yield Contracts**  
  Stake/unstake mechanisms, yield calculation, and payout modules.
- **Upgradeability/Proxy Contracts**  
  Implementation of proxy patterns (if any), and their security implications.
- **Bridging and Interoperability Contracts**  
  Cross-chain bridges and relevant relayers (if integrated).

### B. **DAO Governance Protocol**

- **Proposal Creation and Validation**  
  Access control, anti-spam, and Sybil resistance.
- **Voting Logic**  
  Quorum calculation, double voting prevention, delegation, and tally mechanisms.
- **Execution Security**  
  Timelock implementation, transaction sequencing, and emergency stop controls.

### C. **Infrastructure & Integrations**

- **External Oracle Feeds**  
  (e.g., price oracles, randomness providers)
- **API Endpoints**  
  Interfacing between smart contracts and backend/frontend services.
- **Access Controls & Role Management**  
  Permissions, ownership transfers, and admin logic.

## 3. Audit Exclusions

The following areas are explicitly **excluded** from this audit scope unless otherwise stated:

- Off-chain governance (e.g., forum voting, social consensus)
- Third-party smart contracts and external integrations not controlled by OCOS DAO
- User-side wallet security and device integrity
- Frontend code security (unless specified in separate report)
- General cloud/server infrastructure security (unless specifically integrated with on-chain logic)

---

## 4. Audit Timeframe

- **Initial Audit Date:** June 2025
- **Follow-up Review:** Upon implementation of critical changes or post-mainnet deployment

---

## 5. Audit Deliverables

- Comprehensive findings report (including all vulnerabilities, with risk classification)
- Executive summary and remediation guidance
- Proof of remediation and verification for resolved issues
- Public and investor-facing summary (non-technical)
