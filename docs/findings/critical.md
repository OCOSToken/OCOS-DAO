# üî• Critical Findings Report

Welcome to the **Critical Findings** section of the OCOS DAO Security Audit.  
This document presents all vulnerabilities and weaknesses identified as **critical** during the latest audit phase.

## What are Critical Findings? üö®

**Critical findings** represent security issues or code vulnerabilities that, if exploited, can cause significant loss of assets, loss of control over the DAO, or severe disruption of the protocol‚Äôs functionality.  
Such risks are always a top priority for immediate remediation.

## 1. Re-Entrancy Attack Vector

- **Description:**  
  The staking contract was found vulnerable to a classic re-entrancy attack, which could allow malicious actors to recursively withdraw more funds than they deposited.  
  _This would have led to a total drain of staked assets._ üò±

- **Impact:**  
  Loss of all user deposits in the staking pool.

- **Status:**  
  Resolved ‚úÖ

- **Remediation:**  
  The withdrawal logic was updated to use the "checks-effects-interactions" pattern and the nonReentrant modifier was implemented.

---

## 2. Unchecked Owner Privileges

- **Description:**  
  The Treasury Management contract had several functions callable only by the owner, but there were no multi-signature or DAO-approval requirements.  
  _This could have allowed a single compromised key to seize all DAO funds._ ‚ö†Ô∏è

- **Impact:**  
  Immediate risk of loss or theft of all assets in the DAO treasury.

- **Status:**  
  Pending ‚ùóÔ∏è

- **Remediation Recommendation:**  
  Migrate all critical admin functions to DAO-controlled governance, require multi-signature for treasury movements, and limit direct owner privileges.

---

## 3. Unprotected Upgrade Function

- **Description:**  
  The upgrade function in the proxy contract was accessible without proper authentication or voting, allowing an attacker to replace the contract logic at will.  
  _Could lead to full protocol compromise and loss of control._ üö®

- **Impact:**  
  Malicious upgrade, rug-pull, or permanent loss of user funds.

- **Status:**  
  Resolved ‚úÖ

- **Remediation:**  
  Upgrade functions now require explicit DAO governance approval and time-locked execution.
