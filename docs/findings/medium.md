# OCOS DAO – Medium Risk Findings
_Audit Reference: docs/findings/medium.md_

---

## Overview 🧐

This section documents all **medium-risk findings** identified during the OCOS DAO smart contract audit.  
Medium-risk issues generally **do not cause immediate critical harm** but, if ignored, may lead to vulnerabilities, loss of funds, or undesired behavior in certain edge cases.  
**All findings listed here require timely attention and remediation to ensure the long-term health and security of the DAO.**

## 1. Missing Access Control on Non-Critical Functions 🔒

**Description:**  
Certain non-critical administrative functions (e.g., updating metadata, changing fee parameters) were found to be accessible without proper role-based restrictions.

**Risk:**  
A malicious user may exploit these functions to make unwanted changes, potentially affecting user experience or fee structures.

**Recommendation:**  
Implement explicit access control checks using `onlyOwner`, `onlyAdmin`, or custom modifiers for all admin functions – even those considered low-impact.

**Status:**  
✅ _Remediated in Commit `0x2fa...9c7`_

## 2. Unchecked External Call Return Values 📞

**Description:**  
A few contract methods call external contracts (e.g., price oracles, routers) but do not fully check the returned values for errors or reverts.

**Risk:**  
If an external call fails silently, the contract may continue in an inconsistent state, possibly resulting in loss of funds or inaccurate state updates.

**Recommendation:**  
Use Solidity's `require()` to assert successful calls and log failures. Always verify the return value of low-level calls.

**Status:**  
🕒 _Under review – fix in progress_

## 3. Lack of Event Emission on Key State Changes 🔔

**Description:**  
Several important state-changing functions (like updating settings, enabling/disabling features) currently do not emit events.

**Risk:**  
Without event logs, transparency and on-chain monitoring are reduced, making incident response and audits more difficult.

**Recommendation:**  
Emit descriptive events on every significant state change to ensure full transparency and easier off-chain tracking.

**Status:**  
✅ _Fixed in PR #24, events now cover all major actions_

---

## 4. Gas Inefficiency in Loop Operations ⛽

**Description:**  
Some internal loops do not include upper bounds or may process large arrays, which could result in excessive gas costs for certain user actions.

**Risk:**  
Users might be unable to interact with the contract due to high gas fees or risk running out of gas in critical operations.

**Recommendation:**  
Add reasonable bounds to loops, use mappings where possible, and batch processing for large datasets.

**Status:**  
🕒 _Optimization planned for next release_

## Final Notes 💡

- **Medium-risk issues** are not immediately catastrophic, but ignoring them may cause operational headaches or open the door for more severe exploits later.
- **Proactive remediation** ensures community trust and long-term platform sustainability.
- **Thank you to all contributors** who help identify and fix these issues! 🙏
