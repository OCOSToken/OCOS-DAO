## Overview

This section documents all **high severity vulnerabilities** and issues identified during the OCOS DAO smart contract and platform audit.  
High severity findings indicate risks that can cause **serious financial loss, privilege escalation, critical system misbehavior, or major disruptions** to DAO operations if not remediated promptly.

All findings here require urgent attention and immediate remediation or mitigation to ensure the ongoing safety, integrity, and trust of the OCOS ecosystem. 🔒

## 1. Reentrancy Risk in Treasury Withdrawals

**Description:**  
The `withdraw()` function in the DAO Treasury contract was susceptible to reentrancy attacks, allowing a malicious actor to drain funds by recursively calling the function before the balance is updated.

**Potential Impact:**  
- Loss of DAO funds 😱
- Disruption of treasury operations

**Recommendation:**  
- Apply the “checks-effects-interactions” pattern  
- Use [OpenZeppelin’s ReentrancyGuard](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/api/security#ReentrancyGuard) modifier  
- Add comprehensive unit tests for reentrancy scenarios

**Status:**  
🟠 *Mitigation in progress – patch scheduled for next release*

## 2. Insecure Access Control for Admin Functions

**Description:**  
Certain administrative functions (e.g., setting critical parameters) were accessible to more addresses than intended due to improper role configuration.

**Potential Impact:**  
- Unauthorized changes to protocol parameters  
- Privilege escalation 😬

**Recommendation:**  
- Refactor role-based access control logic  
- Restrict admin actions to verified multi-signature wallets only  
- Regularly review and update access policies

**Status:**  
🟡 *Mitigated in staging – pending production deployment*

## 3. Incomplete Input Validation on Governance Proposals

**Description:**  
The smart contract allowed governance proposals with malformed or malicious input data, which could break off-chain tooling or create confusion in the voting process.

**Potential Impact:**  
- DAO governance instability  
- Community frustration 🤦‍♂️

**Recommendation:**  
- Add strict input validation and data type checks in proposal logic  
- Implement sanity checks in frontend submission forms  
- Monitor proposal submission logs for anomalies

**Status:**  
🟢 *Fixed and verified in latest testnet deployment*

## 4. Price Oracle Manipulation Potential

**Description:**  
The integration with external price oracles did not include proper source verification and rate-limiting, which could allow attackers to manipulate price feeds for economic advantage.

**Potential Impact:**  
- Manipulated DAO token price  
- Financial losses for DAO members 🤑

**Recommendation:**  
- Add whitelisting for trusted oracles  
- Introduce minimum time delays between updates  
- Monitor and alert on price feed anomalies

**Status:**  
🔵 *Open – mitigation design under review*
