# Low Risk Findings üòå

This section documents all findings classified as **Low Risk** during the audit of the OCOS DAO smart contracts and associated infrastructure. While these issues are not critical and do not pose an immediate threat to the system‚Äôs core security or financial integrity, we strongly encourage the OCOS DAO development team and community to review and address them for optimal long-term resilience and user experience.

---

## Summary

- **Total Low Risk Findings:** 3
- **Impact:** Minimal; primarily related to best practices, code readability, or minor operational inefficiencies.
- **Resolution:** Recommended for future maintenance releases or during refactoring phases.

## Findings List

### 1. Gas Optimization Opportunity ‚õΩÔ∏è

- **Description:**  
  In several functions, certain state variables are written to storage more than once within a single transaction. While this does not cause incorrect logic or financial loss, it leads to unnecessary gas consumption.
- **Recommendation:**  
  Refactor affected functions to minimize redundant storage writes. This will reduce transaction costs for users in the long run.

### 2. Lack of NatSpec Comments üìù

- **Description:**  
  Several public and external functions lack [Ethereum NatSpec](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.24/natspec-format.html) documentation comments. Although this does not affect contract execution, it may hinder third-party audits, community review, and future upgrades.
- **Recommendation:**  
  Add comprehensive NatSpec comments to all public/external functions and events for improved code transparency and maintainability.

### 3. Unused Import Statements üì¶

- **Description:**  
  A small number of import statements reference contracts or libraries that are not utilized in the current deployment. While these do not introduce vulnerabilities, they can cause confusion or minor increases in bytecode size.
- **Recommendation:**  
  Remove any unused imports to keep the codebase clean, efficient, and easier to audit.

## Conclusion

Low risk findings do not jeopardize the integrity or security of the OCOS DAO smart contracts at present. However, proactively addressing these issues demonstrates a commitment to best practices, helps foster trust within the community, and paves the way for a more robust DAO ecosystem. üöÄ
