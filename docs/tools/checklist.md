# 🛠️ Audit Tools & Security Checklist

Welcome to the OCOS DAO security audit toolkit.  
Below is a comprehensive checklist of tools, processes, and best practices used throughout every smart contract and infrastructure audit.  
This document helps our contributors, external auditors, and community members understand our technical diligence and transparency standards.  
Feel free to suggest additions or improvements!

## 🔍 1. Static Analysis Tools

- **Slither**  
  Automated static analysis for Solidity contracts, detecting vulnerabilities and code quality issues.

- **MythX**  
  Deep vulnerability scanning for EVM smart contracts (integration with Truffle/Hardhat).

- **Securify**  
  Automated formal verification and compliance checking.

## 🏗️ 2. Development & Testing Frameworks

- **Hardhat**  
  Flexible Ethereum development framework with built-in testing, forking, and deployment scripts.

- **Foundry**  
  Fast, next-generation testing and fuzzing for Solidity smart contracts.

- **OpenZeppelin Test Environment**  
  Secure and standard-based unit testing for contract logic.

---

## 🛡️ 3. Manual Review Procedures

- Code peer review by senior engineers (minimum 2 reviewers per contract)  
- Review for business logic, edge cases, access control, and upgrade patterns  
- Adherence to industry best practices and OCOS DAO’s coding standards

---

## 🧪 4. Fuzz Testing & Simulation

- **Echidna**  
  Automated fuzzing to discover unpredictable vulnerabilities.  
- Custom test scripts simulating attack vectors and extreme edge cases.

---

## ⚡ 5. Dependency & Library Auditing

- Analyze all imported libraries and dependencies for known CVEs  
- Use of `npm audit` and `yarn audit` for continuous monitoring  
- Regular upgrade and patching policy for third-party modules

---

## 🔐 6. Access Control & Privilege Checks

- Verification of `Ownable`, `Role-Based`, and `Multi-Sig` patterns  
- Restrict admin-only functions and verify event emission for state changes  
- Mandatory on-chain governance for privileged operations

---

## 🌐 7. Deployment, Upgrade, and Post-Deployment Controls

- Deployment using multisig or DAO governance wallet  
- Verification of contract source on block explorers (Etherscan, BscScan, etc.)  
- Post-deployment monitoring with on-chain analytics

---

## 📊 8. Continuous Monitoring & Incident Response

- Use of monitoring tools (Tenderly, Forta, OpenZeppelin Defender)  
- Real-time alerting for abnormal activity and critical transactions  
- Incident playbook and immediate response protocol

---

## 📄 9. Documentation & Reporting

- Every audit report and tool output is stored in `/docs/audit-reports/`  
- All vulnerabilities are tracked, remediated, and referenced with commit hashes  
- Community can follow the remediation progress via GitHub Issues and Pull Requests

---

**Checklist Summary**  
✅ All above points must be covered before mainnet deployment  
✅ External audit is required for every major upgrade  
✅ Results are transparently published for the DAO and the public
