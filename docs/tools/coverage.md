# Code Coverage Report Guide 🛡️

## Overview

Code coverage is a key metric that quantifies how much of your smart contract or application codebase is executed during automated tests. High coverage does **not** guarantee bug-free code, but it **greatly increases confidence** in the security and robustness of your system. In decentralized ecosystems like OCOS DAO, comprehensive test coverage is critical for both community trust and external audits. 🔍

---

## Why Code Coverage Matters

- **Risk Reduction:** More lines tested = fewer unexpected vulnerabilities.
- **Audit Readiness:** Auditors require proof of rigorous testing for all core components.
- **Transparency:** The DAO community can directly see what is being tested (and what isn’t!).
- **Continuous Improvement:** Gaps in coverage highlight where more tests are needed. 🧠

---

## Coverage Metrics Explained

- **Line Coverage:** Percentage of executable lines run by tests.
- **Function Coverage:** Percentage of functions invoked during testing.
- **Branch Coverage:** Percentage of possible code branches (e.g., if/else) exercised by tests.
- **Statement Coverage:** Percentage of code statements executed by tests.

> **Goal:** For DAO critical contracts, target at least **95% line & branch coverage**.

## Tools Used 🚀

- **Solidity/Hardhat:** [`solidity-coverage`](https://github.com/sc-forks/solidity-coverage) plugin for Solidity-based smart contracts.
- **JavaScript/TypeScript:** [`nyc`](https://github.com/istanbuljs/nyc) and [`jest`](https://jestjs.io/) for frontend/backends.
- **Python:** [`coverage.py`](https://coverage.readthedocs.io/) for any Python-based services or scripts.
- **Other:** Additional language-specific tools as required (see [tools/README.md](../tools/README.md)).

## How to Generate Coverage Reports 📊

### For Smart Contracts (Solidity/Hardhat)

1. **Install Plugin:**
   ```bash
   npm install --save-dev solidity-coverage
   ```

2. **Run Coverage:**
   ```bash
   npx hardhat coverage
   ```
   - Generates a detailed HTML report in the `coverage/` folder.

3. **Review Results:**  
   Open `coverage/index.html` in your browser to explore coverage by file, function, and line.

---

### For Frontend/Backend

- **JavaScript/TypeScript:**  
  Add `"test:coverage": "nyc jest"` to your `package.json` scripts.  
  Run:
  ```bash
  npm run test:coverage
  ```
  - View coverage details in the terminal or `coverage/` directory.

- **Python:**  
  ```bash
  coverage run -m pytest
  coverage report -m
  coverage html  # for HTML report
  ```

---

## Coverage Targets & Standards 🌟

- **Critical smart contracts:** ≥ 95% line & branch coverage
- **UI and API layers:** ≥ 85% line coverage
- **Scripts & tools:** ≥ 80% recommended

All coverage reports must be published to the `audit-reports/` and `docs/tools/` folders after each major release.  
**Pro-tip:** Include the coverage badge in your `README.md`!  
Example:  
```markdown
![Coverage](https://img.shields.io/badge/coverage-97%25-brightgreen.svg)
```

---

## How to Improve Coverage 📈

- Write **unit tests** for every function (including edge cases!).
- Add **integration tests** for complex contract interactions.
- Review coverage gaps after each run and write tests for any uncovered logic.
- Use **code reviews** to enforce test writing standards. 🧐

---

## Best Practices 🏅

- Always run full coverage before requesting an audit.
- Never sacrifice code readability for coverage tricks.
- Document known “unreachable” or intentionally excluded code in test comments.
- Keep coverage scripts up-to-date with new contracts and modules.
- Encourage the community to contribute new tests!
