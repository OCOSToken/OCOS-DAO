**Status:** In Progress  
**Period:** January 2025 – Present

---

## Executive Summary

The initial phase of the OCOS DAO smart contract and infrastructure audit officially commenced in **January 2025**. Since then, our dedicated audit team—supported by independent third-party partners—has been performing an extensive, methodical review of all critical codebases, governance modules, and treasury flows.

### Current Status

- 🔎 **Ongoing Review:**  
  The audit is actively underway and covers both newly deployed and legacy contracts. Every protocol update, integration, and critical transaction is being continuously examined.
- 🔄 **Living Process:**  
  This audit is intentionally designed as a *living process*, not a one-time event. Each new upgrade, proposal, or feature release will trigger additional targeted reviews.
- 🤝 **Transparency & Community:**  
  All preliminary findings, discovered vulnerabilities, and recommended mitigations are promptly disclosed to the OCOS DAO community, ensuring complete transparency.

### Next Steps

- Ongoing findings and resolutions will be documented in this directory and updated in real time.
- Upon completion of major milestones, detailed summary reports will be published.
- The audit process will **continue indefinitely** to guarantee maximum protocol security and trust for all stakeholders.  
  _(Security is never “final”—we’re committed to continuous improvement!)_
