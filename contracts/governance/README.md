# 🧠 OCOS DAO: Self-Governing Mechanism

The **OCOS Genesis DAO** is more than a voting system — it implements a fully autonomous and self-governing smart contract architecture. This model allows the DAO to evolve, update its internal parameters, and enforce rules without human intervention, governed solely by consensus and code.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

This mechanism enables the DAO to:
- Modify internal governance parameters via proposals
- Execute structural changes automatically
- Maintain protocol-level integrity through decentralized control

> "Humans propose. DAO votes. Code enforces."

---

## 🧩 Architecture Components

### 1. `DAOParameterCore.sol`
Stores key DAO-wide settings:
- `minQuorum`: Minimum number of votes required for proposal validity
- `proposalCooldown`: Time between two proposals from the same address
- `oracleAuthority`: Whitelisted address for external data injection

#### Key Functions:
```solidity
function setParam(string key, uint256 value) external onlyDAO;
function getParam(string key) external view returns (uint256);
```

---

### 2. `AutoExecProposal.sol`
Applies DAO-approved proposals automatically into the DAO core:
```solidity
if (proposalApproved) {
  DAOParameterCore.setParam("minQuorum", 4000);
}
```

---

### 3. `DAOGovernanceKernel.sol`
The execution engine of the DAO:
- Continuously monitors proposal status
- Triggers automatic enforcement when quorum + delay conditions are met

#### Execution Requirements:
- Vote count meets `minQuorum`
- Execution delay has passed (e.g., 24h)

✅ If conditions are met, changes are applied on-chain without manual input

## 🔐 Governance Security

| Mechanism | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `onlyDAO` modifier | Only DAO-approved calls can update core parameters |
| `ExecutionDelay` | Time buffer before enforcement for transparency |
| `RejectionWindow` | Community veto possible before final commitment |

---

## 🔁 Recursive DAO Evolution

The DAO can self-propose updates to its own logic:
> “Adopt new governance logic module for 60-day trial”

If approved:
- DAO updates its own contract reference (e.g., `governanceLogic` address)
- Enables evolutionary governance — code upgrades through consensus

## 🧪 Example Proposals
- Adjust `minQuorum` for proposal validation
- Add or remove oracle data providers
- Change execution delay or cool-down periods

## 🧠 Philosophy
> The less human intervention, the stronger the protocol.
> **Code that governs code becomes the final law.**
