## ðŸ’¼ **Development Notes**

- All pages are written in professional, modern React (with optional Next.js routing compatibility).
- UI/UX is styled with Tailwind CSS for a clean, responsive, and dark-themed design.
- All blockchain data is pulled live from deployed smart contracts (OCOS Token, S47DaoVault, etc.).
- Pages are modular: add new sections or integrate additional blockchain modules as the protocol evolves.
- For new features, follow the naming and structure conventions shown here for easy onboarding and open-source clarity.

## ðŸš€ **Contributing**

- For new pages, copy this README header and document the new route clearly.
- For major UI/logic changes, update this README and the root project documentation.
- All code, comments, and commit messages should be clear, professional, and in English.
