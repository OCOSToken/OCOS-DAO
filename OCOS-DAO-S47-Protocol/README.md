## Introduction

Welcome to a new paradigm in decentralized legacy governance.  
Here, community is not a slogan — it is absolute law.  
A digital heritage, entrusted to the collective, finds its fate determined only by your voice.

- **A singular, immense legacy vault** entrusted to the Protocol.
- **1,000,000,000 units of value** represented in a token, never to be inflated or diluted.
- **47,000 unique destinations** — each one shaped by the wisdom and intent of those who participate.

> "The fate of legacy is not decided by one.  
> It is forged by the will of many."

## The Protocol at a Glance

- **Immutable Supply:** A finite issuance — no inflation, no burn, no exceptions.
- **Transparent Governance:** Every action, vote, and allocation is publicly verifiable, on-chain, and irreversible.
- **Participatory Power:** The influence of each participant is measured transparently and equitably.
- **Epochal Decision-Making:** The Protocol proceeds in cycles (“Rounds”), each culminating in the collective allocation of legacy to selected destinations.
- **Absolute Neutrality:** No privileged actors, no backdoors, no overrides. Only code and community.

## Quick Start

1. **Connect**: Interface with the platform using any supported cryptographic wallet.
2. **Acquire**: Obtain units via the official issuance contract at a constant, transparent value.
3. **Participate**: Cast your intent toward your chosen destination. Influence is proportional to your commitment.
4. **Witness**: Observe the flow and allocation of the legacy — live, on-chain, immutable.

## Core Components

- **The Vault**: An unbreachable, autonomous repository. Its contents are activated and allocated strictly by protocol consensus.
- **The Unit**: A fungible representation of participatory power. Fixed in number, fully auditable, and non-replicable.
- **Destinations**: 47,000 unique endpoints. Each is a potential vessel for legacy, activated solely by the collective intent.
- **Governance Mechanism**: Round-based participatory voting. At the conclusion of each round, allocations are finalized, and history is written.

## Principles

- **Finality**: All on-chain actions are immutable.
- **Equality**: Every participant is bound by the same rules; the Protocol serves no master.
- **Transparency**: Code, process, and history are open to all. Nothing is hidden.
- **Autonomy**: No external intervention. No administrative override.  
- **Legacy**: This is more than code — it is a digital testament.

## For Researchers & Builders

- All contracts, scripts, and governance modules are open-source.
- The Protocol is agnostic to geography, identity, and status.
- Auditable and verifiable by anyone, anytime.
