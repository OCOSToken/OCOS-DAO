# 🌐 OCOS DAO — Genesis-Driven, Self-Governing Blockchain Infrastructure

**OCOS DAO** (On-Chain Operating System) is a next-generation decentralized governance infrastructure inspired by the legacy of Bitcoin (S47) and engineered to operate as a fully autonomous, audit-verifiable, and community-owned decision layer. This repository houses the foundational components of OCOS Genesis DAO: smart contracts, DAO vaults, cryptographic proof systems, governance tooling, and historical data anchoring.

---

## 🧱 Architectural Vision

OCOS DAO is designed to evolve beyond static voting frameworks. It incorporates:

- ✅ **Self-Modifying Governance Logic**
- ✅ **Vaults Anchored in Legacy BTC (S47) Principles**
- ✅ **Decentralized Parameter Mutation (via proposals)**
- ✅ **Immutable Audit Trail and Proof Verifier Contracts**
- ✅ **AES-Encrypted DAO Legacy Storage System (47000+ files)**
- ✅ **Genesis Hash Anchoring & Forkless Autonomy**

> “Genesis is not the beginning. It is the transfer of trust from humans to logic.”

## ⚙️ Core Modules

### 🔐 `contracts/`
- `OCOSGenesisDAO.sol`: Core DAO execution and on-chain consensus
- `OCOSGovernanceToken.sol`: Voting token (ERC20/BEP20 compatible)
- `VaultS47.sol`: Immutable symbolic vault contract linked to S47 address datasets
- `S47ProofVerifier.sol`: Verifies ownership of legacy BTC (S47) via signature
- `DAOParameterCore.sol`: DAO-wide mutable settings controlled by proposals
- `AutoExecProposal.sol`: Automatically applies DAO-passed rule changes
- `DAOGovernanceKernel.sol`: Core governance loop & self-executing decision engine

### 🗳️ `scripts/`
- `deploy_dao.js`, `create_snapshot.js`, `verify_s47_proof.js`
- `submit_proposal.js`, `track_proposal_results.js`
- Scripts support `.env`, `Hardhat`, and `ethers.js` automation

### 🔐 `vaults/`
- `wallet_00001.dat.aes` to `wallet_47000.dat.aes`: Simulated cryptographic reserves
- Indexed via SHA256 checksums
- Used as legacy reference for DAO vote eligibility & historical anchoring

### 📁 `data/`
- `s47_legacy_addresses.json`: Masked legacy BTC address set (22k+)
- `matrix_4700x48.csv`: DAO block analysis across 47 indicators
- `p470shi_blocks.csv`: P470SHI mining pattern reconstructions
- `proofs/`: Includes `s47_claim_proof.json`, vault audit trail hashes

## 🧠 DAO Governance Flow

1. Submit proposal (`submit_proposal.js`)
2. Snapshot taken (`create_snapshot.js`)
3. Voting occurs with token weights
4. `DAOGovernanceKernel.sol` enforces result
5. If param change: `AutoExecProposal.sol` executes logic

## 🧭 Final Message
> “DAO is not a protocol. It is the memory of decisions made by logic, and the refusal to forget who controls the ledger.”
